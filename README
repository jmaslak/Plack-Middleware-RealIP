NAME
    Plack::Middleware::RealIP - Override client IP with header value
    provided by proxy/load balancer

SYNOPSIS
      enable 'Plack::Middleware::RealIP',
          header => 'X-Forwarded-For',
          trusted_proxy => [qw(192.168.1.0/24 192.168.2.1)];

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::RealIP is loose port of the Apache module
    mod_remoteip. It overrides "REMOTE_ADDR" with the IP address advertised
    in the request header configured with "header".

    When multiple, comma delimited IP addresses are listed in the header
    value, they are processed from right to left. The first untrusted IP
    address found, based on "trusted_proxy", stops the processing and is set
    to be "REMOTE_ADDR". The header field is updated to this remaining list
    of unconfirmed IP addresses, or if all IP addresses were trusted, this
    header is removed from the request altogether.

CONFIGURATION
  header
    Sets a request header to trust as the client IP, e.g. X-Client-IP

  trusted_proxy
    A list of IP addresses or subnet blocks which are trusted to provide IP
    header.
